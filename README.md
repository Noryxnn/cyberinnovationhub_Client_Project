At Bedtest™, we offer highly customised software solutions for industrial clients. This project covers a user interface for interaction with our client (Cyber Innovation hub) and their cutting edge supercomputer which simulates various attacks both physical and cyber, before demonstrating on real world models what exactly would happen once the attack has taken place.
